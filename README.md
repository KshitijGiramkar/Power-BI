# PowerBi_dashboard_project
Created a report using Sales Performance data files. First restored the Adventure work database in Excel and then created a report in Power BI with a 'Summary' page showing the 'Top Sales Performer', 'Top Selling Products', and 'Top Performer' with their 'AI Visual Navigator'. Added a 'Customer Details' page showing the customer's information in detail and at last the 'Product Details' page reflecting the details of the products ordered. We could easily navigate between the pages using Drillthrough options.
